# PIE Mnemonic: The Five Premises of Warranted Belief

## Quick Reference for the Gageian Epistemic Model (GEM)

The **PIE Syllogism** establishes the only structurally justified procedure for warranted belief. Each premise is axiomatically necessary and cannot be rejected without fatal contradiction.

## The Five Premises (P1-P5)

| Premise | Formal Term | Mnemonic | Statement | Function |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **P1** | Axiom of Subjective State (S) | **"I AM"** | Every conscious agent has a non-arbitrary Subjective State (S) | Self-Vindicating Precondition - Halts infinite regress |
| **P2** | Axiom of Mental Event (E) | **"SOMETHING HAPPENS"** | A dynamic Mental Event (E) occurs within this state | Triggers Inquiry (I) |
| **P3** | Axiom of Structural Pragmatism (G) | **"I MUST RESOLVE IT"** | Inquiry (I) necessitates the Goal (G) of resolution | Halts Arbitrariness/Dogmatism |
| **P4** | Internal Coherence (C) | **"IT MUST BE COHERENT"** | Intrinsic Knowledge (JCB) achieved when Goal (G) is satisfied by Internal Coherence (C) | Grants Intrinsic Knowledge (JCB) |
| **P5** | Terminal Reliability (R) | **"IT MUST WORK EXTERNALLY"** | Extrinsic Knowledge (JRB) achieved when JCB is constrained by verifiable Reliability (R) | Transitions to Extrinsic Knowledge (JRB) |

## The Two Knowledge Standards

### Justified Coherent Belief (JCB)
- **Premises Required:** P1, P2, P3, P4
- **Warrant:** Internal Coherence (C)
- **Scope:** Claims contained entirely within the Subjective State (S)
- **Examples:** Mathematical truths, logical proofs, "I am thinking"
- **Defense:** Secure against regress, arbitrariness, and incoherence

### Justified Reliable Belief (JRB)
- **Premises Required:** P1, P2, P3, P4, P5
- **Warrant:** External Reliability (R) + Internal Coherence (C)
- **Scope:** Claims about the world external to Subjective State (S)
- **Examples:** Scientific facts, empirical observations, predictions
- **Defense:** Secure against all five structural flaws (including circularity)

## How the GEM Defeats the Agrippa Trilemma

1. **Infinite Regress** → Halted by P1 (Self-Vindicating Precondition)
2. **Arbitrary Dogmatism** → Defeated by P3 (Necessary Goal of resolution)
3. **Circular Reasoning** → Controlled by P5 (External Reliability constraint)

## The Gage Pentalemma: Five Fatal Contradictions

Each premise is defended against rejection by demonstrating that denial creates an immediate contradiction:

1. **Horn 1 - Performative Contradiction:** Cannot reject P1 (Subjective State) without using it
2. **Horn 2 - Functional Contradiction:** Cannot reject P2 (Mental Event) without executing it
3. **Horn 3 - Arbitrariness:** Rejecting P3 (Goal) makes inquiry arbitrary
4. **Horn 4 - Incoherence:** Rejecting P4 (Coherence) prevents resolution
5. **Horn 5 - Circularity:** Rejecting P5 (Reliability) traps external claims in self-reference

## The Structural Mandate

**The PIE Syllogism is the only non-arbitrary path to warranted belief available to a conscious agent.**

Knowledge is necessarily either:
- **JCB** (Justified Coherent Belief), or
- **JRB** (Justified Reliable Belief)

There is no third option that escapes structural contradiction.
